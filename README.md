### Basic Info:

This is a Node.js script to download the daily videos from the [LMG Floatplane](https://linustechtips.com/main/store/) and format them to be viewed in [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/). You can also  view the raw files in the download folder.

This requires a **[Floatplane](https://linustechtips.com/main/store/)** subscription.

**Important Note: You may need to update the cookies in the script occasionally, the guide on how to do this is [Part 4 of the Script Guide](https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-PlexDownloader/blob/master/wiki/script.md)**

### **Install Guide**

 * Make sure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** installed on your system to use this.
 * If you want to use **[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)** to browse the files installed you must have it installed.
 * If you encounter any issues then feel free to create a issue here or just PM me on **[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) Sir Inrix | <3#6950**.

I will be maintaining this as I use it.

If you want to open Plex files in your own Media Player eg, VLC, MPC-BE, WindowsMediaPlayer. Go and install this tampermonkey script here: **https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer** **Important Note** for chrome users: https://github.com/Kayomani/PlexExternalPlayer/issues/16

**Note**: If anyone from LTT or Floatplane does not want me to have this publically avalible please just contact me and I will remove it.
